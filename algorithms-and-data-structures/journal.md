4-2 Milestone 3

The artifact I selected is a set of Java-based service classes from my mobile application project: ContactService, TaskService, and AppointmentService. These services were originally created during my coursework in CS-320 – Software Test, Automation, and QA, and they manage in-memory data structures for storing, updating, and deleting user objects such as contacts, tasks, and appointments. The core functionality centered on CRUD operations, but I enhanced the artifact by adding search and filtering functions for tasks and appointments. This was created in December 2024.

I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and enhance object-oriented solutions that use algorithms and data structures effectively. Specifically, the new search and filtering methods highlight my skill in implementing efficient iteration and conditional logic, while ensuring code readability and maintainability. The enhancement showcases my ability to take an existing system and improve its functionality in a way that adds value for the end user, which aligns with the professional skills expected of a software developer.

This artifact was improved by integrating case-insensitive search capabilities that allow users to filter through tasks and appointments by name or description. In doing so, I demonstrated algorithmic thinking by iterating through data collections and applying condition checks to return filtered results. The improvements not only increased the functionality of the system but also strengthened the demonstration of my ability to work with object-oriented structures and optimize access to in-memory data.

With this enhancement, I successfully met the course outcomes I had planned to target in Module One. These included Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and Outcome 4: Demonstrate ability to implement computer solutions that deliver value. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans because this enhancement aligned directly with the goals I set at the beginning of the course and successfully demonstrated those competencies.

Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, I learned the importance of balancing simplicity with efficiency when working with algorithms and data structures. Although the underlying search implementation was straightforward, I needed to ensure that it was both accurate and easy to maintain. One of the challenges I faced was designing the search in a way that could handle partial matches and differences in capitalization while still being efficient. Writing unit tests for the new methods was also a critical part of the process, as it validated that the enhancements worked across multiple edge cases. The experience reinforced the importance of iterative improvement, thorough testing, and keeping the user’s needs in mind when enhancing software functionality.
