# Michael Laudano â€” ePortfolio

Completing my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University has been a rewarding journey that strengthened my technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and professional communication skills. Through coursework and projects, I developed a strong foundation in software design, algorithms, databases, and cybersecurity, skills that directly support my career goal in digital forensics.

Working on collaborative projects taught me how to contribute effectively in team environments, manage shared code using GitHub, and communicate complex technical information clearly to both technical and nontechnical audiences. I also refined my ability to think algorithmically, designing efficient and maintainable software solutions that demonstrate sound data structure use and secure programming practices.

My ePortfolio showcases these strengths through three key artifacts: a software engineering project featuring authentication and forensic logging, a mobile app project demonstrating algorithmic efficiency and data management, and a MongoDB project focused on secure database access and audit logging. Together, these works highlight my growth as a developer with a strong security mindset and my readiness to apply these skills to real-world digital forensics challenges.
