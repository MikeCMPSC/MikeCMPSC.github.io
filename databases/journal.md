5-2 Milestone 4

The artifact I selected for my ePortfolio is a Python-based MongoDB client and server application developed for the Grazioso Salvare project. The original version of this artifact was created in January 2025 as part of the CS-340: Client/Server Development course. The program was initially designed to import animal rescue data from a CSV file into a MongoDB database, create indexes for optimized queries, and configure user authentication to ensure secure data access. For the enhancement, I expanded the projectâ€™s functionality by adding an audit logging and query tracking feature that simulates forensic data analysis. This enhancement allows the system to log user queries and activity in a dedicated MongoDB audit log collection, supporting traceability, accountability, and data integrity, critical aspects of real-world secure database systems.

I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it best demonstrates my growing skills in software development, database design, and security awareness, all of which align with my long-term goal of pursuing a career in digital forensics. The components that particularly showcase my abilities are the implementation of secure authentication practices, query optimization through indexing, and the development of the new audit logging system. These updates transformed the project from a basic database client into a more robust and secure application capable of supporting forensic investigations through query tracking. By replacing hardcoded credentials with secure environment-based authentication, the program also demonstrates my understanding of secure coding principles.

The enhancement aligns with several course outcomes, including implementing computer solutions that deliver value, developing a security mindset to ensure data privacy and integrity, and employing strategies for collaborative environments through multi-user access and shared audit logs. I met the course outcomes I planned to achieve in Module One, and the improvements made through this enhancement further solidified my understanding of secure, auditable database systems.

Throughout the enhancement process, I learned how to integrate audit logging effectively into a database-driven application and how critical proper authentication and data traceability are in both software development and forensic analysis. One of the main challenges I faced was configuring secure MongoDB authentication without hardcoding credentials, which required understanding how to safely handle sensitive information using environment variables. Another challenge was ensuring the audit logging system recorded accurate user activity without affecting database performance. The process of enhancing and modifying this artifact deepened my technical knowledge and reinforced my interest in applying software development skills within the field of digital forensics.
