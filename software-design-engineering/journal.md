3-2 Milestone 2

The artifact I selected is my Rescue Animals Project from IT-145: Foundations in Application Development (October 2023). This project originally consisted of a series of Java classes (Driver.java, RescueAnimal.java, Dog.java, and Monkey.java) that implemented a simple, menu-driven application to intake, reserve, and manage rescue animals. The original version of the project focused on demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts, inheritance, encapsulation, and the use of collections in Java. At the time, the goal was to learn the fundamentals of software development, but the system was intentionally kept simple and operated entirely with in-memory data structures, without any authentication or persistent storage.

I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates both my growth in software engineering and my aspirations for a career in digital forensics. By enhancing this project, I was able to show how I can take a foundational academic project and elevate it into something that aligns with professional best practices. Specifically, the enhancements I made, implementing user authentication, database integration, and forensic login logging, demonstrate my ability to design secure workflows, anticipate adversarial behavior, and build audit-ready systems. These skills are directly relevant to digital forensics, where accountability, traceability, and security are critical. The components of the artifact that best showcase my abilities include the creation of a DBUtil utility class to modularize database access, the integration of forensic logging into the login process, and the restructuring of the Driver.java class to enforce secure access before the menu system can be used.

The enhancements clearly demonstrate coverage of the course outcomes I identified in Module One. Outcome 2 was achieved through the creation of pseudocode, flowcharts, and detailed inline documentation that explain how the enhanced system works. Outcome 3 was demonstrated in the use of algorithmic principles to design and evaluate authentication and logging workflows. Outcome 4 was realized by delivering a tangible computing solution that provides value through increased security and forensic readiness. Finally, Outcome 5 was strongly met by incorporating a security mindset, anticipating adversarial exploits (such as failed login attempts), and ensuring all attempts were logged for accountability. At this stage, I do not have any changes to my outcome-coverage plans, as the enhancements align perfectly with my original intent.

The process of enhancing and modifying this artifact taught me the importance of modular design and forward planning. Integrating a database into a project that was originally file-based required me to rethink how system components communicate, which in turn improved my understanding of separation of concerns in software design. I also gained practical experience working with JDBC, SQL schema design, and logging strategies that support forensic investigation. One challenge I faced was ensuring the login system was secure yet user-friendly, as authentication can often introduce complexity. Another challenge was balancing the original simplicity of the project with the new features, making sure the system remained accessible. Overall, the enhancement process helped me bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application, reinforcing my career goals in software security and digital forensics.
